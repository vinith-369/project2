    Welcome to the **Plant Disease Recognition System**! üåøüîç

    **How It Works:**
    - Upload an image of a plant with suspected disease.
    - The system will analyze it to detect potential diseases.
    - Get results and recommendations instantly!

    ### Features
    - **High Accuracy:** Using advanced ML algorithms.
    - **User-Friendly:** Intuitive interface for easy use.
    - **Fast Results:** Quick analysis for prompt action.

    Navigate to the **Disease Recognition** page to start.
